  </em>
  <p>I am a student at NIT Hamirpur persuing my B.Tech in Computer Science. I am currently at 3rd year of my B.Tech and
    I am learning new skills and new programming languages. Since I have not done any internship before, so I want to do
    internship now from good companies, so if anyone is able to help me to get so, then please contact me. Since my
    B.Tech I have not done anything which is helpful to do something and can help me to get the internship or anything
    which can help me in anything, so I am learning new skills to get able to do something and get a decent job
    somewhere.<br><br>Link to contact <em>Contact</em></p>
